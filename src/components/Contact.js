            I recently started photography in February, and have used 35mm film, medium-format, as well as full-frame digital. My biggest challenge is
            photographing subjects close up, and I am still overcoming my aversion to it. My favorite street photography is wide angle and personal, so
            it is a hurdle that I am eager to overcome.
